# Programming: Wolfram Language and Mathematica for researchers

This course introduces the Wolfram Language and the Mathematica environment from the point of view of an user interested (or experienced) in computer programming and the processing or simulation of research data. 

No prior knowledge of the Wolfram Language or Mathematica is expected, the necessary "programming patterns" and workflows will be introduced through the course.

# What you need to start

- An installation of Mathematica (v10+), a free trial may be downloaded from [wolfram.com/mathematica/trial/](wolfram.com/mathematica/trial/) or see [physics.ox.ac.uk/it/mathematica/](http://www.physics.ox.ac.uk/it/mathematica/) to see if you have access to the Oxford University license
